Instructions for study
==========================
1. Each user is expected to work with 20 testcases ( 5 Java, 10 Android and 5 C# testcases). URL of a page containing links to all testcases will
be emailed to the user.
2. Each testcase will contain these sections:
	a. title of a programming task (e.g., Q: xxxxx)
	b. description of the task with more words. (e.g., D: yyyyyyy)
	c. testcase # and file ID (don't worry about these)
	d. a code segment(e.g., few lines of code, a method or whole class) solving that programming problem/task.
	e. A list of three comments discussing issues, concerns or useful tips for improvement in the code.
	f. rating scales associated with accuracy, preciseness, conciseness and usefulness of those three comments.
3. A user will first attempt to understand the programming problem as well as the solution code.
4. S/he then will analyze each of those three comments, and attempt to find out if the discussed issues, concerns or tips in the comments
are really meaningful, informative, thought-provoking and useful.
5. When a developer starts working with other's code, s/he needs to comprehend and then further analyze the code statically 
before actually working on it. The goal is to determine if such comments could be useful in this case.
6. The user will then provide the ratings for each testcase using his/her best judgements. 
[Please note that your professional opinion matters, and I am expecting your unbiased evaluation]
7. Each testcase would take roughly 5-7 minutes (might be subjective), so the whole study is expected to finish 
within 1.5-2.0 hours.
8. Each user will be compensated with a good amount.
9. Here is an example testcase, you might look at before starting the study.

Further clarification about comment quality:
=================================================
Accurate: if the discussed topic is correct and relevant with the code.
Precise: if the discussed issue specific to certain item in the code, not just a general statement.
Concise: if the comment conveys a substantial meaning using limited number of words.
Useful: if information in the comment is meaningful for any static program analysis such as comprehension, review or reuse.

[Please note that the ratings are on the three comments as a whole.]
